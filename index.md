### What is a full stack developer ?

A full stack developer has the functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. A full stack developer should have knowledge in front end and back end development. Front end developers build the visible parts of applications that users see and interact with. Back end developers on the other hand, are responsible for building the parts the user does not see, which include core computational logic, server and database.
